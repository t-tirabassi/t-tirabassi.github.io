Knightmourne is a dark fantasy dungeon crawler that thrusts the player into a cursed land, ravaged by war and moral decay. Players take the role of a paladin sent out by the Church, and find themselves in a festering swamp, with a single purpose: descend through the dungeon and purge the land of its sins.

With fast-paced combat, strategic artifact combinations, and rich environmental storytelling. Knightmourne is a game where every room is a battlefield and every artifact holds a piece of the world’s lost history.

&nbsp;

* Combat: Responsive action with simple switching between melee (sword) and ranged (bow) comabt. Unlock new weapons like a staff for a more powerful ranged attack throughout the descent of the dungeon.

* Dungeon Structure: The dungeon consists of eight floors, starting with a tutorial swamp level followed by seven themed levels, each presided over by a boss representing one of the Seven Deadly Sins.

* Room Lock System: Most rooms will seal upon entry, forcing players to fight off waves of enemies before advancing. Helps to keep tension high and rewards skillful gameplay.

* Artifact System: Players can find the artifacts of ancient warriors scattered around the dungeon. The artifacts have the potential to be combined to create powerful synergies and create a more personalized build. All artifacts come with their own lore but some combinations will unlock unique lore or secret powers.

* Lore Discovery: The story unfolds as the player journeys through the dungeon with the player being able to see the hintings of a once great empire’s ultimate fall from grace.
