### What is Knightmourne?

Knightmourne is a dark fantasy dungeon crawler that thrusts the player into a cursed land, ravaged by war and moral decay. Players take the role of a paladin sent out by the Church, and find themselves in a festering swamp, with a single purpose: descend through the dungeon and purge the land of its sins.

With fast-paced combat, strategic artifact combinations, and rich environmental storytelling. Knightmourne is a game where every room is a battlefield and every artifact holds a piece of the worldâ€™s lost history.
