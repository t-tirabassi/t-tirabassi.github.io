Moloka'i Connect was an team formed through the collaborations between the University of Hawai'i at Manoa (UHM), the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (DHHL), and the State of Hawai'i with the sole task of working closely with the Connect Kakou initiative and the Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program (TBCP) to bridge the digital divide faced by the island of Moloka'i. This large scale project took place over the course of a University semester from January 2025 to May 2025. The team consisted of students Jordan Launstein, Payton Higa, Micah Schoefield, and myself. Each stduent was givben a role to carry out for the project and I was designated as one of the two project managers. My responsibilities included community outreach and interviewing, presenation setup and research, scheduling, soltuion brainstroming, and product creation. Many of the responsibilities for this project were shared and spread throughout the team. Our goal was to create a product or solution that could be used to combat the initial problem statement, which proved much more difficult than we had anticipated with many dead ends, turns, and ideas being completely thrown out as we learned more about the situation and got to talk to more professional and locals.
