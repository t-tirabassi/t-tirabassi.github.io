SpireBooks is a financial projection and management decision tool **developed for Spire Hawaii** to help employees and stakeholders visualize projections, perform audits, and manage financial data efficiently. The application was built as a course project in ICS 414: Software Engineering II by my team, Team Half & Half.

### Mini Case Study

**Problem:** Spire Hawaii needed a web application to consolidate financial projections, manage user-specific data, and provide easy-to-read reports for employees and stakeholders.  

**Role:** I contributed to **UI design and functionality, user roles and account data, application acceptance tests, component management, and code refactoring** throughout the project lifecycle.  

**Tech Stack:** React, Meteor, Bootstrap, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, JSX  

**Solution:** Developed a responsive web app that:  
- Supported multiple user roles with role-specific data access  
- Visualized projections through adjustable graphs and forms  
- Implemented a structured Agile workflow (IDPM) with code reviews, milestones, and task assignments  
- Enhanced code maintainability through component management and refactoring  

**Impact:** Enabled Spire Hawaii employees to efficiently input, track, and interpret financial data, improving decision-making and reporting workflows. Although the app is not publicly deployed due to contractual agreements, the repository and project board demonstrate the implementation and design details.
