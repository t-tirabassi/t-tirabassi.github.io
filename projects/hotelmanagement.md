### Project Overview

<img width="250px" 
     class="rounded float-start pe-4" 
     src="../img/hotelmanagement/hotel-managementstock.jpeg" >

This Hotel Management System was developed as the final project for the course ICS 212: Program Structure. Our team of five built the system in C++, dividing responsibilities across different program components. I served as the team lead, overseeing the project, coordinating integration, and refining the final build for presentation.

We initially attempted a vector-based structure but encountered persistent bugs so I opted to lead the debugging process and transitioned the system to a C-string–based approach. My primary contributions included developing the Hotel class, implementing the room management features, building the customer search functionality, and debugging the full system.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Below is the project's **README** file, outlining each team members' assigned tasks as well as an overview of the code:

```cpp
Group 6 Hotel Management System

Group Members:

Zai 
John
Kayla
JaySuh
T

Member Tasks:

John - CheckIn, CheckOut, getSummaryReport, debugging

JaySuh - Customer class, delete room, debugging

Zai - Room Class, addRoom, available rooms, debugging

Kayla - switch case statements, sub and main menu, debugging

T - Hotel class, room management system functions, searchCustomer, debugging

Code Overview:

- Room class containing room details about room #, ac, comfort, etc. using constructors

- Room details displayed through function

- Customer class containing and aligning with customer details (name, address, phone, stay duration, payment, etc.). Getter function for getting the booking ID by name for case 4. 

- Customer details displayed through function

- Hotel Management class inheriting from Room class using customer and room details, room management system, customer search, check-in check-out (payment calculations), availability, summary report, and menu display functions

- main function containing do while loop for menu using switch case statement for options prompted through user input

- idea for further iteration: make checkOut take checkIn and checkOut dates to automatically calculate bill without user input

- avail rooms issue fixed, originally would iterate empty inputs, possibly due to input of enter for next records, had trouble trying to fix but is all working now

- deleteRooms function fixed, would just pop back to main menu

- other functionality and fundamental issues fixed using time given till Sunday
```

&nbsp;

Upon running the program users would be presented with this menu within the console:

```cpp
######## Hotel Management #########

1. Manage Rooms
2. Check-In Room
3. Available Rooms
4. Search Customer
5. Check-Out Room
6. Guest Summary Report
7. Exit

Enter Option:
```

Here, they would enter one of the main menu options and follow the subsequential prompts for each. From there, they would also be able to return to this main menu at any time.

&nbsp;

We developed the system within VS Code as such:

### Learning Outcomes

This project strengthened my technical and collaborative skills. Working in a team environment effectively mirrored real-world software development, where each member contributed different components that had to integrate cleanly. The experience improved my leadership skills, deepened my proficiency in C++ concepts, and exposed me to the real-life challenges of building a functioning system from scratch. It also highlighted how core programming principles translate into both academic and real-world applications.

Here is the full code that my team and I developed for the project:

```cpp

#define max 100 //prevents exceeding

    std::string address;

    int booking_id;
};
